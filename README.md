# [Project 1: Bank Marketing](https://github.com/Fazleem/Bank_Marketting)

## About
Banks have been facing problems to find clients who might be interested in investing long-term deposits. As the organizations do not want to spend their time reaching the clients who would never be interested in long-term investments, this work is to visualize the data and analyze the factors that might increase the success rate. Different approaches to analyze the attributes that contribute to the success of bank telemarketing have been made. A large set of 17 features that are related to bank clients are analyzed1. This helps the organization to reduce the list of clients to be considered and focus on customers that would find the products interesting. The hidden factors which might show a high success rate on marketing can also be discovered by this work.

### Goal
The goal of the project is to correctly classify which customers would be interested to take long term deposits and who don't
