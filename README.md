# [Project 1: Bank Marketing](https://github.com/Fazleem/Bank_Marketting)

## About
Banks have been facing problems to find clients who might be interested in investing long-term deposits. As the organizations do not want to spend their time reaching the clients who would never be interested in long-term investments, this work is to visualize the data and analyze the factors that might increase the success rate. Different approaches to analyze the attributes that contribute to the success of bank telemarketing have been made. A large set of 17 features that are related to bank clients are analyzed. This helps the organization to reduce the list of clients to be considered and focus on customers that would find the products interesting. The hidden factors which might show a high success rate on marketing can also be discovered by this work.

### Goal
The goal of the project is to correctly classify which customers would be interested to take long term deposits and who don't

# [Project 2: Digit Recognization: Project Overview](https://github.com/Fazleem/Digit_Recognizer)

## About
This classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

### Goal
The goal of the project is to build a flexible architecture that correctly classify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images


### Training & Validation data Plot
The plot tells us that initially the training loss is pretty high (apprximately 0.4), as the epoch increases and by adding a double convolution layers with batch normalization, the amount of loss gradually decreased.

### Predictions
From the below plots we could see that most of the images are classified correctly using this architecture
